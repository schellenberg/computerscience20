It's raining hard.  Water is going to come in through the open windows unless Reeborg closes them. Open windows look like this:

.. image:: images/open_window.png

Have Reeborg move around the room and close the windows by using the ``build_wall()`` function. The size of the room and the location of the windows are always changing.

.. note:: Since the windows are in different places in each world, be sure that your solution does not *hard code* a number of steps to get to a window. Instead, Reeborg must check for an open window as it walks around the inside of the house.
