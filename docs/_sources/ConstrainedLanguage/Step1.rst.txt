    - **CS20-CP1** Apply various problem-solving strategies to solve programming problems throughout Computer Science 20.


Tutorial
--------

In some worlds, Reeborg may have a specific place it needs to get to. For example, when you open the Step 1 world, you will see an image of Reeborg's home.

Reeborg's world is a simple grid, and we can refer to any part of the grid using an x and y coordinate. This is the same as a Cartesian plane from math class! In this world, Reeborg needs to get back home, which is at x=5 and y=1, or (5,1).


Saving Your Work
----------------

Although the code you are creating for this first few worlds is quite simple, as you progress to the more difficult steps, you will want to save your code. 

**To save the code** you have created, use the **Ctrl-S** keyboard shortcut (**Cmd-S** on a Mac).

**To load code** you have saved previously, use the **Ctrl-O** keyboard shortcut (**Cmd-O** on a Mac).

.. note:: If your teacher has asked you to show them your code as you progress through the steps, you may find it helpful to open a new tab when you have completed a step, but are waiting for your teacher. That way, you can have a number of steps easily available for your teacher to look at when they get to you.



Your Turn
---------

Open Step 1 on the |reeborg_environment|.

Give Reeborg the appropriate instructions to make it return home!
