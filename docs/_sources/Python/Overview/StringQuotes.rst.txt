Which Quotes to Use When Creating Strings
==========================================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Triple quoted strings can span multiple lines, and contain other types of quotes. Work on a Python assignment, focused on input/output of strings, and conditionals.

A Bit More Detail About Strings
--------------------------------

Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes (``'``) or double
quotes (``"`` - the double quote character), or three of the same separate quote characters (``'''`` or ``"""``).

.. activecode:: ch02_4
    :nocanvas:

    print(type('This is a string.') )
    print(type("And so is this.") )
    print(type("""and this.""") )
    print(type('''and even this...''') )


Double quoted strings can contain single quotes inside them, as in ``"Bruce's
beard"``, and single quoted strings can have double quotes inside them, as in
``'The knights who say "Ni!"'``.
Strings enclosed with three occurrences of either quote symbol are called
triple quoted strings.  They can contain either single or double quotes:

.. activecode:: ch02_5
    :nocanvas:

    print('''"Oh no", she exclaimed, "Ben's bike is broken!"''')

Triple quoted strings can even span multiple lines:

.. activecode:: ch02_6
    :nocanvas:

    print("""This message will span
    several lines
    of the text.""")

Python doesn't care whether you use single or double quotes or the
three-of-a-kind quotes to surround your strings.  Once it has parsed the text of
your program or command, the way it stores the value is identical in all cases,
and the surrounding quotes are not part of the value.

.. activecode:: ch02_7
    :nocanvas:

    print('This is a string.')
    print("""And so is this.""")


What Does This Program Do?
---------------------------

.. note:: Your teacher may choose to use the following examples as a class activity, by displaying the  examples, and having you take a guess as to what you think each will do before running the code. 

What will the following programs output? Why?

Can you fix the error in the following programs?

    song_quote = 'Leonard Cohen, in his song "Anthem", sings "There is a crack in everything; That's how the light gets in."'

    print(song_quote)

    :nocodelens:

    part_one = "Leonard Cohen, in his song "Anthem", sings"
    part_two = 'There is a crack in everything; That's how the light gets in.'

    print(part_one + part_two)

    interesting_quotes = 'There's a lot of people who have said interesting things. Some fun quotes include:
    
    "What I cannot create, I do not understand." - Richard Feynman
    "Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers." - Voltaire
    "Our ignorance of history causes us to slander our own times." - Gustave Flaubert'

    print(interesting_quotes)


.. note:: 

    Another alternative to concatenating strings together is to use f-strings (formatted string literals). An f-string allows you to easily create a string that has the *value* of variables inserted into it. To create an f-string, you simply put the letter ``f`` before the quotes that begin the string. This tells Python that it should look for variable names inside the string, and if it finds any, it will replace them with the value of that variable. For Python to find the variable, you must enclose the variable inside curly brackets, like ``{some_variable}``. Consider this example of using an f-string::

        name = "Eli"
        age = 14

        greeting = f"Hello, {name}. I heard you just turned {age}!"
        print(greeting)

        # this code will print the following:
        # Hello, Eli. I heard you just turned 14!


Assignment Work Time

Please spend the rest of the class continuing to work on your current Python assignment (likely something emphasizing user input and output).
