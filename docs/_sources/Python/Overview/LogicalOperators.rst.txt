.. index:: and, or, not


``and``, ``or``, ``not``
----------------------------

There are three **logical operators**: ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``. The
semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English.
For example, ``x > 0 and x < 10`` is true only if ``x`` is greater than 0 *and*
at the same time, x is less than 10.  How would you describe this in words?  You would say that x is between 0 and 10, not including the endpoints.

``n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0`` is true if *either* of the conditions is true,
that is, if the number is divisible by 2 *or* divisible by 3.  In this case, one, or the other, or both of the parts has to be true for the result to be true.

Finally, the ``not`` operator negates a boolean expression, so ``not  x > y``
is true if ``x > y`` is false, that is, if ``x`` is less than or equal to
``y``.

.. activecode:: local_operators_example_1

    x = 5
    print(x > 0 and x < 10)

    n = 25
    print(n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0)


.. caution:: Common Mistake!

    There is a very common mistake that occurs when programmers try to write boolean expressions.  For example, what if we have a variable ``number`` and we want to check to see if its value is 5,6, or 7.  In words we might say: "number equal to 5 or 6 or 7".  However, if we translate this into Python, ``number == 5 or 6 or 7``, it will not be correct.  The ``or`` operator must join the results of three equality checks.  The correct way to write this is ``number == 5 or number == 6 or number == 7``.  This may seem like a lot of typing but it is absolutely necessary.  You cannot take a shortcut.

.. mchoice:: test_question6_2_1
   :answer_a: x &gt; 0 and &lt; 5
   :answer_b: x &gt; 0 or x &lt; 5
   :answer_c: x &gt; 0 and x &lt; 5
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: Each comparison must be between exactly two values.  In this case the right-hand expression &lt; 5 lacks a value on its left.
   :feedback_b: Although this is legal Python syntax, the expression is incorrect.  It will evaluate to true for all numbers that are either greater than 0 or less than 5.  Because all numbers are either greater than 0 or less than 5, this expression will always be True.
   :feedback_c: Yes, with an and keyword both expressions must be true so the number must be greater than 0 an less than 5 for this expression to be true. Although most other programming languages do not allow this mathematical syntax, in Python, you could also write 0 &lt; x &lt; 5.

   What is a correct Python expression for checking to see if a number stored in a variable x is between 0 and 5?


.. index:: operator precedence

Precedence of Operators
-----------------------

We have now added a number of additional operators to those we have learned.  It is important to understand how these operators relate to the others with respect to operator precedence.  Python will always evaluate the arithmetic operators first (** is highest, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction).  Next comes the relational operators.  Finally, the logical operators are done last.  This means that the expression ``x*5 >= 10 and y-6 <= 20`` will be evaluated so as to first perform the arithmetic and then check the relationships.  The ``and`` will be done last.  Although many programmers might place parenthesis around the two relational expressions, it is not necessary.

The following table summarizes the precedence discussed so far from highest to lowest.  

=======   ==============  ===============
Level     Category        Operators
=======   ==============  ===============
7(high)   exponent        \**
6         multiplication  \*, /, //, %
5         addition        +, -
4         relational      ==, !=, <=, >=, >, <
3         logical         not
2         logical         and
1(low)    logical         or
=======   ==============  ===============

.. mchoice:: test_question6_3_1
   :answer_a: ((5*3) &gt; 10) and ((4+6) == 11)
   :answer_b: (5*(3 &gt; 10)) and (4 + (6 == 11))
   :answer_c: ((((5*3) &gt; 10) and 4)+6) == 11
   :answer_d: ((5*3) &gt; (10 and (4+6))) == 11
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Yes, * and + have higher precedence, followed by &gt; and ==, and then the keyword &quot;and&quot;
   :feedback_b: Arithmetic operators (*, +) have higher precedence than comparison operators (&gt;, ==)
   :feedback_c: This grouping assumes Python simply evaluates from left to right, which is incorrect.  It follows the precedence listed in the table in this section.
   :feedback_d: This grouping assumes that &quot;and&quot; has a higher precedence than ==, which is not true. 

   Which of the following properly expresses the precedence of operators (using parentheses) in the following expression: ``5*3 > 10 and 4+6==11``

Here is an animation for the above expression:

.. showeval:: se_tq631
   :trace_mode: true

   5 * 3 > 10 and 4 + 6 == 11
   ~~~~
   {{5 * 3}}{{15}} > 10 and 4 + 6 == 11
   {{15 > 10}}{{True}} and 4 + 6 == 11
   True and {{4 + 6}}{{10}} == 11
   True and {{10 == 11}}{{False}}
   {{True and False}}{{False}}


Generic Truth Tables
--------------------

One useful way to think about logical expressions is to use truth tables.  A truth table is a table that shows all possible values of a logical expression.  Consider the following truth table for the ``and`` operator:

=======  =======  =======
p        q        p and q
=======  =======  =======
True     True     True
True     False    False
False    True     False
False    False    False
=======  =======  =======


The truth table for the ``or`` operator is as follows:

=======  =======  =======
p        q        p or q
=======  =======  =======
True     True     True
True     False    True
False    True     True
False    False    False
=======  =======  =======


The truth table for the ``not`` operator is as follows:

=======  =======
p        not p
=======  =======
True     False
False    True
=======  =======

For the ``not`` operator, there is only one input, so the table is simpler.  The ``not`` operator simply negates/flips the input.



Specific Truth Table Example
----------------------------

This might be easier to understand if we pick a specific example.  Let's say that ``p`` is ``it is raining`` and ``q`` is ``it is cold``.  The truth table would then look like this:

========  =======  =================
raining   cold     raining and cold
========  =======  =================
True      True     True
True      False    False
False     True     False
False     False    False
========  =======  =================

The truth table for the ``or`` operator is as follows:

=======  =======  =================
raining  cold     raining or cold
=======  =======  =================
True     True     True
True     False    True
False    True     True
False    False    False
=======  =======  =================


If we combine all of these ideas into a single example, we can see how the truth tables work.  Consider the following expression:

``not raining and cold or raining``

The truth table for this expression would be as follows:

========  ======  ============   =====================   ================================
raining   cold    not raining    not raining and cold    not raining and cold or raining
========  ======  ============   =====================   ================================
True      True    False          False                   True
True      False   False          False                   True
False     True    True           True                    True
False     False   True           False                   False
========  ======  ============   =====================   ================================

Using a truth table is a useful tool for debugging complex logical expressions.  If you are ever unsure about how a complex logical expression will evaluate, you can always write out a truth table to help you understand it.

Divisible by 3 or 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. You should print out a message to the user, either "That number is divisible by either 3 or 5", or "That number is not divisible by either 3 or 5". *Be sure to consider the data type of the input you are taking in from the user. Use a single if/else block to solve this problem.*

Turtle Stuck In a Square
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have been given some starter code for the problem below. **You only need to change one line of the code, specifically the line containing the while loop.** Replace the word ``something`` with the appropriate boolean questions that will cause the turtle to continue moving until it gets to one of the edges of the square. Each time the program is run, the turtle will pick a new random direction to move. When executed, your program should look something like this:

.. image:: images/stuck_in_square.gif

Note that you can get the current x coordinate of the turtle by calling ``bob.xcor()``, and the current y coordinate by calling ``bob.ycor()``. Also remember that the turtle begins at the origin (0, 0), which is in the center of the screen. The vertices of the square have x and y coordinates as shown below:

.. image:: images/stuck_in_square_coordinates.png


.. activecode:: turtle-stuck-in-square
    :nocodelens:
    :enabledownload:

    import turtle
    import random

    canvas = turtle.Screen()

    bob = turtle.Turtle()

    # draw a square to represent the area the turtle needs to stay inside
    bob.speed(0) 
    bob.penup()
    bob.goto(-100, -100) # sends bob to a specific coordinate
    bob.pendown()
    for side in range(4):
        bob.forward(200)
        bob.left(90)
    bob.penup()

    # reset turtle to normal starting location
    bob.goto(0, 0)
    bob.speed(3)

    # pick random direction to move
    some_angle = random.randrange(1, 360)
    bob.setheading(some_angle)

    # complete the while statement below
    # you should only need to adjust one line of code (directly under this comment)
    while something:
        bob.forward(5)

.. not (bob.xcor() > 100 or bob.xcor() < -100 or bob.ycor() < -100 or bob.ycor() > 100)
