EasyGUI_Qt Reference
====================

EasyGUI_Qt is inspired by EasyGUI and contains a number of different basic graphical user interface components. The version you are using is forked from `https://github.com/aroberge/easygui_qt <https://github.com/aroberge/easygui_qt>`_, and adds just a few changes to make things easier for students to use (improved install process by adding PyQt5 as a dependency, added get_file_name function). The following reference covers a subset of the functions that are most accessible to a student at the CS20 level, so you may want to read the `official docs of the original project <http://easygui-qt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_ if you would like to explore more usage options. If you explore the official docs, you may find it useful to know that you can call functions with only some of the arguments (this is called optional arguments). If you do this, however, you need to specify *which* argument you are passing, like ``easy.get_string(message="Some prompt/question:", default_response="Some string")``.


Installation
-------------

In Thonny, open Tools â†’ Manage Packages and type in ``cs20-easygui`` into the search bar, then click Install. This installation will take some time, as part of the installation is the backend graphical rendering engine (PyQt5).


Showing Messages
-----------------

If you call ``show_message`` with a single argument, that argument should be a string containing the message you would like to show.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    easy.show_message("Enter your message here, or pass in a variable containing a string.")

.. image:: images/showing-messages1.png

**Additional Options**

If you call ``show_message`` with a second argument (separated by a comma), that second argument should also be a string, and will be interpreted as the title the pop up window should have.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    easy.show_message("My message goes here!", "Some Title")

.. image:: images/showing-messages2.png

Getting Strings
----------------

To create a pop up window that prompts the user to enter a string, use the ``get_string`` function. This function will return whatever the user types in (as a string). If the user presses *Cancel*, or closes the window, this function will return ``None``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_string("What is your name?")

.. image:: images/getting-strings1.png

**Additional Options**

If you call ``get_string`` with a second argument (separated by a comma), that second argument should also be a string, and will be interpreted as the title the pop up window should have.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_string("What is your name?", "Name")

.. image:: images/getting-strings2.png

If you call ``get_string`` with a third argument (separated by a comma), that third argument should also be a string, and will be interpreted as the default value inside the input box.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_string("What is your name?", "Name", "John Doe")

.. image:: images/getting-strings3.png


Getting Integers
----------------

To create a pop up window that prompts the user to enter an integer, use the ``get_integer`` function. This function will return an integer, and forces the user to only enter numbers. If the user presses *Cancel*, or closes the window, this function will return ``None``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_integer("How old are you?")

.. image:: images/getting-integers1.png


**Additional Options**

If you call ``get_integer`` with a second argument (separated by a comma), that second argument should be a string, and will be interpreted as the title the pop up window should have.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_integer("How old are you?", "Age")

.. image:: images/getting-integers2.png

If you call ``get_integer`` with a third argument (separated by a comma), that third argument should be an integer, and will be interpreted as the default value inside the input box.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_integer("How old are you?", "Age", 16)

.. image:: images/getting-integers3.png

If you call ``get_integer`` with five arguments (separated by commas), the fourth argument should be an integer representing the minimum value allowed, and the fifth argument should be an integer representing the maximum value allowed.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_integer("How old are you?", "Age", 16, 0, 120)

.. image:: images/getting-integers4.png


Getting Floats
----------------

To create a pop up window that prompts the user to enter an float, use the ``get_float`` function. This function will return a float, and forces the user to only enter numeric values. If the user presses *Cancel*, or closes the window, this function will return ``None``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_float("How tall are you (in meters)?")

.. image:: images/getting-floats1.png


**Additional Options**

If you call ``get_float`` with a second argument (separated by a comma), that second argument should be a string, and will be interpreted as the title the pop up window should have.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_float("How tall are you (in meters)?", "Height")

.. image:: images/getting-floats2.png

If you call ``get_float`` with a third argument (separated by a comma), that third argument should be a float, and will be interpreted as the default value inside the input box.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_float("How tall are you (in meters)?", "Height", 1.82)

.. image:: images/getting-floats3.png

If you call ``get_float`` with five arguments (separated by commas), the fourth argument should be a number (int or float) representing the minimum value allowed, and the fifth argument should be a number (int or float) representing the maximum value allowed.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_float("How tall are you (in meters)?", "Height", 1.82, 0.22, 2.72)

.. image:: images/getting-floats4.png

If you call ``get_float`` with six arguments (separated by commas), the sixth argument should be an integer representing the number of decimals allowed.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    answer = easy.get_float("How tall are you (in meters)?", "Height", 1.82, 0.22, 2.72, 2)

.. image:: images/getting-floats5.png

Getting Selection from Drop-Down List
--------------------------------------

To create a pop up window that prompts the user to select an option from a drop-down list, use the ``get_choice`` function. This function will return a string containing the user's choice. If the user presses *Cancel*, or closes the window, this function will return ``None``.

This function requires three arguments, the prompt message (as a string), the window title (as a string), and the choices the user can choose from (as a list).

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    prompt = "What is your favourite subject?"
    title = "Best Subject"
    choices = ["Computer Science", "Math", "Phys Ed", "English", "History"]

    reply = easy.get_choice(prompt, title, choices)

.. image:: images/getting-choice.png

Getting Multiple Selections from List
--------------------------------------

To create a pop up window that prompts the user to select an option (or more than one option) from a list, use the ``get_list_of_choices`` function. This function will return a list containing the user's choices. If the user presses *Cancel*, closes the window, or does not select any options, this function will return an empty list.

This function requires two arguments, the window title (as a string), and the choices the user can choose from (as a list).

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy
    prompt = "Subjects You Enjoy"
    choices = ["Computer Science", "Math", "Phys Ed", "English", "History"]

    reply = easy.get_list_of_choices(prompt, choices)

.. image:: images/getting-multiple-selections.png

Getting A Password
-------------------

To create a pop up window that prompts the user to enter a password, use the ``get_password`` function. This function will return a string containing the user's input. If the user presses *Cancel*, or closes the window, this function will return ``None``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy

    reply = easy.get_password("Please enter your password")

.. image:: images/getting-password1.png

**Additional Options**

If you call ``get_password`` with a second argument (separated by a comma), that second argument should be a string, and will be interpreted as the title the pop up window should have.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy

    reply = easy.get_password("Please enter your password", "Password")

.. image:: images/getting-password2.png


Getting A Yes/No Answer
------------------------

To create a pop up window that prompts the user to answer either Yes or No, use the ``get_yes_or_no`` function. This function will return a boolean (``True`` if they clicked Yes, ``False`` if they clicked No). If the user presses *Cancel*, or closes the window, this function will return ``None``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy

    reply = easy.get_yes_or_no("Fight the monster?")

.. image:: images/getting-yes-no1.png


**Additional Options**

If you call ``get_yes_or_no`` with a second argument (separated by a comma), that second argument should be a string, and will be interpreted as the title the pop up window should have.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy

    reply = easy.get_yes_or_no("Fight the monster?", "Fight")

.. image:: images/getting-yes-no2.png


Getting An RGB Color Value
---------------------------

To create a pop up window that prompts the user to select a color, use the ``get_color_rgb`` function. This function will return a list with the RGB values of the selected color. If the user presses *Cancel*, or closes the window, this function will return ``None``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy

    color = easy.get_color_rgb()

    r = color[0]    # access the amount in the red channel
    g = color[1]    # access the amount in the green channel
    b = color[2]    # access the amount in the blue channel

.. image:: images/getting-color.png


Get File Name Path
--------------------

To create a pop up window that prompts the user to select a file from their computer, use the ``get_file_name`` function. This function will return a string containing the full path to the file they selected. If the user presses *Cancel*, or closes the window, this function will return an empty string ``''``.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy

    selected_image = easy.get_file_name()

.. image:: images/getting-file-name1.png


**Additional Options**

If you call ``get_file_name`` with a second argument (separated by a comma), that second argument should be a string, and will be interpreted as the title the pop up window should have.

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy

    selected_image = easy.get_file_name("Select Image")

.. image:: images/getting-file-name2.png


Display HTML Formatted Text
----------------------------

To create a pop up window that shows rendered HTML, use the ``show_html`` function.

This function requires two arguments, the window title (as a string), and the HTML to render (also a string).

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy

    some_html = """
    <h1>Example</h1>
    <p>This is just an example of <em>some</em> of the things you can 
    do when rendering HTML. There are many more things you could do:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>other HTML tags you learn</li>
        <li>including images</li>
        <li>much more!</li>
    </ul>"""

    easy.show_html("Demo", some_html)

.. image:: images/showing-html.png


Display HTML Formatted Text
----------------------------

To create a pop up window that shows the contents of a file as rendered HTML, use the ``show_file`` function.

This function requires three arguments, the path of the file (as a string), the window title (as a string), rendering engine to use (also a string).

.. sourcecode:: python

    import easygui_qt as easy

    file = "path/to/index.html"
    easy.show_file(file, "File Demo", "html")

.. image:: images/showing-file1.png


**Additional Options**

When calling the ``show_file`` function, you can choose between the following rendering engines:

- ``text``
- ``code``
- ``html``
- ``python``

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    import easygui_qt as easy

    file = "path/to/some_script.py"
    easy.show_file(file, "File Demo", "python")
