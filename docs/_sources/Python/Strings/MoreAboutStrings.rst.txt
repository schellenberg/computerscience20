**What will the following programs output? Why?**

    :caption: What will this program print?

    fruit = "pineapple"
    for poorly_named_variable in fruit:
        print(poorly_named_variable)



Traversal and the ``for`` Loop: By Index
----------------------------------------

It is also possible to use the ``range`` function to systematically generate the indices of the characters.  The ``for`` loop can then be used to iterate over these positions. 
These positions can be used together with the indexing operator to access the individual
characters in the string.

Consider the following codelens example.

.. codelens:: string_for_loop_by_index_1

    fruit = "apple"
    for current_index in range(5):
        current_char = fruit[current_index]
        print(current_char)

The index positions in "apple" are 0,1,2,3 and 4.  This is exactly the same sequence of integers returned by ``range(5)``.  The first time through the for loop, ``current_index`` will be 0 and the "a" will be printed.  Then, ``current_index`` will be reassigned to 1 and "p" will be displayed.  This will repeat for all the range values up to but not including 5.  Since "e" has index 4, this will be exactly right to show all 
of the characters.

In order to make the iteration more general, we can use the ``len`` function to provide the bound for ``range``.  This is a very common pattern for traversing any sequence by position.  Make sure you understand why the range function behaves
correctly when using ``len`` of the string as its parameter value.

.. activecode:: string_for_loop_by_index_2
    :nocanvas:

    fruit = "apple"
    for current_index in range(len(fruit)):
        print(fruit[current_index])


You may also note that iteration by position allows the programmer to control the direction of the
traversal by changing the sequence of index values.  Recall that we can create ranges that count down as well as up so the following code will print the characters from right to left. 

.. note:: Remember that when using the ``range()`` function with three arguments, the arguments are interpreted as ``starting_number``, ``ending_number``, and ``amount_to_step_by``. The range function begins at the ``starting_number``, and goes up to, but not including, the ``ending_number``.


.. codelens:: string_for_loop_by_index_3

    fruit = "apple"
    for current_index in range(len(fruit)-1, -1, -1):
        print(fruit[current_index])

Trace the values of ``current_index`` and satisfy yourself that they are correct.  In particular, note the start and end of the range.

    How many times is the letter o printed by the following statements?

    .. code-block:: python

        sentence = "python rocks"
        for current_index in range(len(sentence)):
            if current_index % 2 == 0:
                print(sentence[current_index])


.. index:: in, not in

The ``in`` and ``not in`` operators
-----------------------------------

The ``in`` operator tests if one string is a substring of another:

.. activecode:: string_in_not_in_1
    
    print('p' in 'apple')
    print('i' in 'apple')
    print('ap' in 'apple')
    print('pa' in 'apple')

Note that a string is a substring of itself, and the empty string is a 
substring of any other string. *(Also note that computer scientists 
like to think about these edge cases quite carefully!)*

.. activecode:: string_in_not_in_2
    
    print('a' in 'a')
    print('apple' in 'apple')
    print('' in 'a')
    print('' in 'apple')
    
The ``not in`` operator returns the logical opposite result of ``in``.

.. activecode:: string_in_not_in_3

    print('x' not in 'apple')


.. index:: accumulator pattern

The Accumulator Pattern with Strings
------------------------------------

Combining the ``in`` operator with string concatenation using ``+`` and the accumulator pattern, we can
write a function that removes all the vowels from a string.  The idea is to start with a string and iterate over each character, checking to see if the character is a vowel.  As we process the characters, we will build up a new string consisting of only the nonvowel characters.  To do this, we use the accumulator pattern.

Remember that the accumulator pattern allows us to keep a "running total".  With strings, we are not accumulating a numeric total.  Instead we are accumulating characters onto a string.

.. activecode:: string_accumulator_pattern_1
    
    def remove_vowels(original_string):
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        string_without_vowels = ""
        for this_char in original_string:
            if this_char not in vowels:
                string_without_vowels = string_without_vowels + this_char
        return string_without_vowels 
       
    print(remove_vowels("compsci"))
    print(remove_vowels("aAbEefIijOopUus"))

Line 5 uses the ``not in`` operator to check whether the current character is not in the string ``vowels``. The alternative to using this operator would be to write a very large ``if`` statement that checks each of the individual vowel characters.  Note we would need to use logical ``and`` to be sure that the character is not any of the vowels.

.. sourcecode:: python

    if each_char != 'a'  and each_char != 'e'  and each_char != 'i'  and
       each_char != 'o'  and each_char != 'u'  and each_char != 'A'  and
       each_char != 'E'  and each_char != 'I'  and each_char != 'O'  and
       each_char != 'U':      
       
         string_without_vowels = string_without_vowels + each_char
      

Look carefully at line 6 in the above program (``string_without_vowels = string_without_vowels + each_char``).  We will do this for every character that is not a vowel.  This should look
very familiar.  As we were describing earlier, it is an example of the accumulator pattern, this time using a string to "accumulate" the final result.
In words it says that the new value of ``string_without_vowels`` will be the old value of ``string_without_vowels`` concatenated with
the value of ``each_char``.  We are building the result string character by character. 

Take a close look also at the initialization of ``string_without_vowels``.  We start with an empty string and then begin adding
new characters to the end.

Step through the function using codelens to see the accumulator variable grow.

.. codelens:: string_accumulator_pattern_2
    
    def remove_vowels(original_string):
        vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
        string_without_vowels = ""
        for each_char in original_string:
            if each_char not in vowels:
                string_without_vowels = string_without_vowels + each_char
        return string_without_vowels 
       
    print(remove_vowels("compsci"))

Practice Problems
------------------

Try the following practice problems. You can either work directly in the textbook, or use Thonny. Either way, be sure to save your solution into your Computer Science 20 folder when you finish!

**Hint: For each of the following, you will want to use the accumulator pattern with strings. In other words, you first need to create an empty string, then concatenate letters onto it as needed.**


Even Letters of a Word
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. activecode:: practice_problem_string_more_info_1

    :enabledownload:

    Create a function with a single parameter ``word`` that returns the even letters of the ``word`` (the first letter is even, since we start counting our index values at 0). For example, given the ``word`` "Saskatoon", the function should return "Ssaon".

    **Examples:**

    ``even_letters("Saskatoon") → "Ssaon"``

    ``even_letters("Saskatchewan") → "Ssacea"``

    ``even_letters("Roughriders") → "Ruhies"``
    ~~~~
    def even_letters(word):
        return ""

        def testOne(self):
            self.assertEqual(even_letters("Saskatoon"),"Ssaon",'even_letters("Saskatoon")')
            self.assertEqual(even_letters("Saskatchewan"),"Ssacea",'even_letters("Saskatchewan")')

.. reveal:: reveal_string_manipulation_even_letters_hint
    :showtitle: Need a Hint?
    :hidetitle: Hide Hint

    Since you are trying to get only the even letters, you need to know which index value you are currently on. That means we need to traverse the string using a ``for counter in range()`` style loop. The accumulator pattern will look something like this::

        def even_letters(word):
            new_word = ""
            for counter in range(len(word)):
                # add a question here...
                new_word = new_word + word[counter]
            return new_word
