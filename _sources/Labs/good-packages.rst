Useful Python Packages
=======================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    A listing of some of the Python packages that previous students have used in their projects.


Installing the Packages
------------------------

In Thonny, open Tools â†’ Manage Packages, then type the name of the package (like ``pygame``) and click Search. Now click install.

If you're using VS Code (or some other editor that doesn't include a simple way to manage your Python packages), you can accomplish the same thing by typing ``pip install pygame`` into a terminal. Personally, I use ``pipenv install pygame``, which creates virtual environments for you  (so you can have lots of different projects that all have their own dependencies).


pyGame
-------

Install by searching ``pygame`` in Manage Packages. You can use this to create graphical games in Python. Some good resources to learn this include:


Arrow
------

Install by searching ``arrow`` in Manage Packages. You can use this to create and manipulate dates and times. For example, you can easily calculate how many days until New Years, or whatever else you feel like doing. Read the documentation at https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Bokeh
------

Install by searching ``bokeh`` in Manage Packages. You can use this to charts/plots/visualizations of data, which will open up in your web browser. To get started, check out https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps/first_steps_1.html
