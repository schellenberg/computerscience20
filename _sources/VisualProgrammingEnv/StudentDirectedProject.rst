Student Directed Project
========================

.. topic:: Quick Overview of Day

    Work periods to put the concepts learned so far into practice. You can choose to create anything you'd like, so long as the project you choose demonstrates that you understand the ideas we've studied.

    :showtitle: Curriculum Outcomes Addressed In This Section

    - **CS20-CP1** Apply various problem-solving strategies to solve programming problems throughout Computer Science 20.
    - **CS20-FP1** Utilize different data types, including integer, floating point, Boolean and string, to solve programming problems.
    - **CS20-FP2** Investigate how control structures affect program flow.
    - **CS20-SD1** Develop a coding project or conduct research in an area of computer science of the student’s choice.


Now that you have learned quite a number of concepts with Scratch, you should try to build a project that puts these ideas to use. Be sure that the project you choose allows you to demonstrate your understanding of:

- broadcast (to control program flow)
- loops (repeat, repeat until, forever blocks)
- conditionals (if, if/else blocks)
- variables

If you would like to explore some new concepts in your project, you might consider researching:

- clones (found in the Control tab)
- lists (found in the Data tab)
- reacting to video and audio input (found in the Sensing tab)
