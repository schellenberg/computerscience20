Boolean Functions
------------------

We have already seen that boolean values result from the evaluation of boolean expressions.  Since the result of any expression evaluation can be returned by a function (using the ``return`` statement), functions can return boolean values.  This turns out to be a very convenient way to hide the details of complicated tests. For example:

.. activecode:: boolean_functions_1

    def is_divisible(x, y):
        if x % y == 0:
            result = True
        else:
            result = False

        return result

    print(is_divisible(10, 5))

The name of this function is ``is_divisible``. It is common to give **boolean
functions** names that sound like yes/no questions.  ``is_divisible`` returns
either ``True`` or ``False`` to indicate whether the ``x`` is or is not
divisible by ``y``.

We can make the function more concise by taking advantage of the fact that the
condition of the ``if`` statement is itself a boolean expression. We can return
it directly, avoiding the ``if`` statement altogether:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def is_divisible(x, y):
        return x % y == 0


Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:

.. sourcecode:: python

    if is_divisible(x, y):
        ... # do something ...
    else:
        ... # do something else ...

It might be tempting to write something like
``if is_divisible(x, y) == True:``
but the extra comparison is redundant.  You only need an ``==`` expression if you are comparing some other type than boolean. (``is_divisible(x, y) == False`` can also be made more concise as 
``not is_divisible(x, y)``). The following example shows the ``is_divisible`` function at work.  Notice how
descriptive the code is when we move the testing details into a boolean function.  Try it
with a few other actual arguments to see what is printed.

.. activecode:: boolean_functions_2

    def is_divisible(x, y):
        return x % y == 0

    if is_divisible(10, 5):
        print("That works")
    else:
        print("Those values are no good")

Here is the same program in codelens.  When we evaluate the ``if`` statement in the main part of the program, the evaluation of
the boolean expression causes a call to the ``is_divisible`` function.  This is very easy to see in codelens.

.. codelens:: boolean_functions_codelens_1
    :showoutput:

    def is_divisible(x, y):
        return x % y == 0

    if is_divisible(10, 5):
        print("That works")
    else:
        print("Those values are no good")

   :feedback_b: A Boolean function may take any number of arguments (including 0, though that is rare), of any type.
   :feedback_c: A Boolean expression is a statement that evaluates to True or False, e.g. 5+3==8.  A function is a series of expressions grouped together with a name that are only executed when you call the function.

   What is a Boolean function?

.. mchoice:: boolean_function_check_2
   :answer_a: Yes
   :answer_b: No
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: It is perfectly valid to return the result of evaluating a Boolean expression.
   :feedback_b: x +y < z is a valid Boolean expression, which will evaluate to True or False.  It is perfectly legal to return True or False from a function, and to have the statement to be evaluated in the same line as the return keyword.

   Is the following statement legal in a Python function (assuming x, y and z are defined to be numbers)?

   .. code-block:: python

     return x + y < z


Randomly Walking Turtles
------------------------

Suppose we want to entertain ourselves by watching a turtle wander around
randomly inside the screen.  When we run the program we want the turtle and
program to behave in the following way:

#. The turtle begins in the center of the screen.
#. Flip a coin. If it's heads then turn to the left 90 degrees. If it's tails
   then turn to the right 90 degrees.
#. Take 50 steps forward.
#. If the turtle has moved outside the screen then stop, otherwise go back to
   step 2 and repeat.

Notice that we cannot predict how many times the turtle will need to flip the
coin before it wanders out of the screen, so we can't use a for loop in this
case. In fact, although very unlikely, this program might never end;
that is why we call this indefinite iteration.


So based on the problem description above, we can outline a program as follows:

.. code-block:: html

    create a window and a turtle

    while the turtle is still in the window:
        generate a random number between 0 and 1
        if the number == 0:  # flipped heads
            turn left
        else:                # flipped tails
            turn right
        move the turtle forward 50


Now, probably the only thing that seems a bit confusing to you is the part
about whether or not the turtle is still in the screen.  But this is the nice
thing about programming, we can delay the tough stuff and get *something* in
our program working right away.  The way we are going to do this is to
delegate the work of deciding whether the turtle is still in the screen or
not to a boolean function.  Let's call this boolean function ``is_in_screen`` We
can write a very simple version of this boolean function by having
it always return ``True``, or by having it decide randomly.
The point is to have it do something simple so that we can focus on the parts
we already know how to do well and get them working.  For now, we will just return ``True``, so our turtle will never stop moving.

.. activecode:: iter_randwalk1
    :nocodelens:

    import random
    import turtle


    def is_in_screen(the_window, the_turtle):
        return True


    canvas = turtle.Screen()

    justyn = turtle.Turtle()
    justyn.shape('turtle')

    while is_in_screen(canvas, justyn):
        coin = random.randrange(0, 2)
        if coin == 0:              # heads
            justyn.left(90)
        else:                      # tails
            justyn.right(90)

        justyn.forward(50)

    canvas.exitonclick()


Now we have a working program that draws a random walk of our turtle, with the obvious problem that the turtle will never stop moving.  We are in a good position,
because a large part of our program is working and we can focus on the next
bit of work -- deciding whether the turtle is inside the screen boundaries or
not.

We can find out the width and the height of the screen using the
``window_width`` and ``window_height`` methods of the screen object.
However, remember that the turtle starts at position 0,0 in the middle of the
screen.  So we never want the turtle to go farther right than width/2 or
farther left than negative width/2.  We never want the turtle to go further
up than height/2 or further down than negative height/2.  Once we know what
the boundaries are we can use some conditionals to check the turtle position
against the boundaries and return ``False`` if the turtle is outside or
``True`` if the turtle is inside.

Once we have computed our boundaries we can get the current position of the
turtle and then use conditionals to decide.  Here is one implementation:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def is_in_screen(the_window, the_turtle):
        left_bound = -(the_window.window_width() / 2)
        right_bound = the_window.window_width() / 2
        top_bound = the_window.window_height() / 2
        bottom_bound = -(the_window.window_height() / 2)

        turtle_x = the_turtle.xcor()
        turtle_y = the_turtle.ycor()

        still_in = True
        if turtle_x > right_bound or turtle_x < left_bound:
            still_in = False
        if turtle_y > top_bound or turtle_y < bottom_bound:
            still_in = False

        return still_in

There are lots of ways that the conditional could be written.  In this case
we have given ``still_in`` the default value of ``True`` and use two ``if``
statements
to possibly set the value to ``False``.  You could rewrite this to use nested
conditionals or ``elif`` statements and set ``still_in`` to ``True`` in an else
clause.

Here is the full version of our random walk program.

.. activecode:: iter_randwalk2
    :nocodelens:

    import random
    import turtle

    def is_in_screen(the_window, the_turtle):
        left_bound = -(the_window.window_width() / 2)
        right_bound = the_window.window_width() / 2
        top_bound = the_window.window_height() / 2
        bottom_bound = -(the_window.window_height() / 2)

        turtle_x = the_turtle.xcor()
        turtle_y = the_turtle.ycor()

        still_in = True
        if turtle_x > right_bound or turtle_x < left_bound:
            still_in = False
        if turtle_y > top_bound or turtle_y < bottom_bound:
            still_in = False

        return still_in


    canvas = turtle.Screen()

    justyn = turtle.Turtle()
    justyn.shape('turtle')

    while is_in_screen(canvas, justyn):
        coin = random.randrange(0, 2)
        if coin == 0:              # heads
            justyn.left(90)
        else:                      # tails
            justyn.right(90)

        justyn.forward(50)


    print("All done. I'm off the screen now!")
    canvas.exitonclick()

We could have written this program without using a boolean function.
You might want to try to rewrite it using a complex condition on the while statement.
However, using a boolean function makes the program much more readable and easier
to understand.  It also gives us another tool to use if this was a
larger program and we needed to have a check for whether the turtle
was still in the screen in another part of the program.  Another advantage is
that if you ever need to write a similar program, you can reuse this function
with confidence the next time you need it.  Breaking up this
program into a couple of parts is an example of **functional decomposition** (in which a problem is broken down into smaller parts, in order to make solving each part of the problem easier).


Detecting If Turtles are Touching
-----------------------------------

When trying to create a visualization with turtles, it can be helpful to be able to ask if two turtles are "touching" each other. One fairly simple way to test this is to create a boolean function that determines if the turtles are within some distance of each other. To do this, we will use the distance equation that you have likely learned in math class.

Assume that we want to find the distance between the two turtles (represented by circles) below. The turtle locations are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively.

.. image:: images/turtle_distance.png

In order to calculate the distance between these two points, we construct a right triangle, then calculate the distance between the two turtles as the hypotenuse of that triangle.

.. image:: images/turtle_distance_triangle.png

Knowing how to do this by hand, we can now create a boolean function that will return True or False, based on whether or not the turtles are less than the required distance apart. One possible implementation of this is:

.. code-block:: python

    def turtles_are_touching(first_turtle, second_turtle, close_enough_distance):
        """Returns True or False, based on whether two turtles are 'close enough' to be touching."""

        x_dist = first_turtle.xcor() - second_turtle.xcor()
        y_dist = first_turtle.ycor() - second_turtle.ycor()
        
        distance_apart = ( x_dist**2 + y_dist**2) ** 0.5
        
        if distance_apart < close_enough_distance:
            return True
        else:
            return False

To make sure that this function is working the way we want it to, we can create a simple testing program. In this program, we will have two turtles start on opposite sides of the screen, face each other, then continue to move towards each other until they are "close enough" to be touching.

.. activecode:: distance_formula_testing_program
    :nocodelens:

    import turtle

    def turtles_are_touching(first_turtle, second_turtle, close_enough_distance):
        """Returns True or False, based on whether two turtles are 'close enough' to be touching."""

        x_dist = first_turtle.xcor() - second_turtle.xcor()
        y_dist = first_turtle.ycor() - second_turtle.ycor()
        
        distance_apart = ( x_dist**2 + y_dist**2) ** 0.5
        
        if distance_apart < close_enough_distance:
            return True
        else:
            return False


    canvas = turtle.Screen()
    canvas.bgcolor("black")

    charlie = turtle.Turtle()
    charlie.color("blue")
    charlie.up()

    musawer = turtle.Turtle()
    musawer.color("red")
    musawer.up()

    charlie.goto(-200, 0)
    musawer.goto(200, 5)

    musawer.left(180)

    while not turtles_are_touching(charlie, musawer, 20):
        charlie.forward(5)
        musawer.forward(2)


    print("That's close enough!")


Experiment with the program above by changing the "close enough" argument being passed into the ``turtles_are_touching`` function.
