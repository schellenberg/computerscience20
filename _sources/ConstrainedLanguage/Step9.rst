Tutorial
--------

Often, we will find that we want to repeat a series of instructions a
fixed number of times. For example, in Step 8, you had to tell Reeborg to do the same thing over and over again. There is a way in Python to do this ... but it
has too many new concepts to explain right now. I will just show you
the code, and immediately introduce ``repeat``, a simpler replacement
for it, unique to Reeborg's World.  The standard way
is known as a **for loop** (which we will use later in the course) and is written as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(n):
        # some
        # instructions
        # here

In Reeborg's World, we can write a ``repeat`` *loop* as follows::

    repeat n:    # where n is a natural number, like 3 or 7
        # some
        # instructions
        # here

.. note::

   Using ``repeat`` will not work in Python programs meant to be
   run outside of Reeborg's World. 

A **loop** is a block of instructions that is repeated. Each time the loop is repeated is called an iteration, so the code below would have 4 iterations.

The following code will make Reeborg trace a square::

    repeat 4:
        move()
        turn_left()

By using ``repeat``, we can rewrite some function definitions without
having to repeat instructions::

    def turn_right():
        repeat 3:
            turn_left()

You might want to adjust the code that you have saved in the library tab to use the repeat block.

.. admonition:: For educators

    The rationale for having ``repeat`` as an addition to Python's
    standard notation is to avoid having to introduce 4 concepts
    at the same time (loops, variables as in ``_`` in ``for _ in range(n)``,
    builtin functions like ``range`` as well as the concept of
    function arguments).

    By design the ``n`` in ``repeat n`` **must** be an integer literal;
    it cannot be a variable.  When students learn about variables, they
    should learn the proper Python syntax to do loops and forget about
    the non-standard ``repeat``.

Adjust the solution you created for Step 8, this time making use of at least two repeat loops. The world doesn't change from Step 8, but your solution should be much nicer. Remember to use comments and whitespace to increase the readability of your solution!
