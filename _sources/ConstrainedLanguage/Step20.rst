Reeborg needs to move around the room and close the windows by using the ``build_wall()`` function, but this time the room will not be rectangular. The shape of the room, size of the room, and the location of the windows are always changing.

To help you get started with this problem, consider the following question. Imagine that Reeborg is standing next to a wall, takes a single step, and finds that there is no longer a wall next to him. What can happen if Reeborg takes another step? *Hint: there are two possible cases.*
